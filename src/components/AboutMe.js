					Regardless of how much I learn, I am forever mesmerised by the scope of technology in the modern world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the moment I wrote my first lines of HTML code in Notepad on a Windows XP desktop PC at the age of 14, I was captivated, and wanted to be a part of this revolution.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon gaining a degree in Computer Science, I started my own coding and maths academy, growing to a turnover of Â£1million within 5 years.
				</p>
				<p>
					All the while, still offering my developer services on a freelance basis, working on both small individual builds and larger team based projects, creating websites, apps, databases, writing algorithms for machine learning and much more.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have been riding my childhood tech dreams ever since I first opened that Notepad file at the age of 14.
